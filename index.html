            <p>
            My personal website is a space where I showcase myself and my work. It consists of three sections: "About Me," "Contact," and "Resume." In the "About Me" section, I introduce myself and provide a brief background of who I am and what I do. The "Contact" page allows visitors to reach out to me directly, and the "Resume" page contains a detailed summary of my education, skills, and work experience. With this website, I hope to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional background and demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers and collaborators.
